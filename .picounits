[symbols]
# Common analytical/natural units style (t = time, l = length, m = mass)
# Uncomment and modify as needed
# time: s
# length: l
# mass: m
# current: I
# thermal: Θ
# amount: N
# luminosity: J
# dimensionless: 1

# Standard SI defaults (used if lines above are commented)
time: s
length: m
mass: kg
current: A
thermal: K
amount: mol
luminosity: cd
dimensionless: ∅

[order]
# Change the order of dimensions in printed units
# Lower number = appears earlier (e.g., mass first in SI)
# Example for t/l/m style: time first
# TIME: 0
# LENGTH: 1
# MASS: 2

# Default SI order (mass · length · time · ...)
MASS: 0
LENGTH: 1
TIME: 2
CURRENT: 3
THERMAL: 4
AMOUNT: 5
LUMINOSITY: 6
DIMENSIONLESS: 7
